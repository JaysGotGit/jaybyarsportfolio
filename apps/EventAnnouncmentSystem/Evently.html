Scenario: Anycompany's Internal Engagement Platform<p>
Company Profile:
Anycompany Inc. is a mid-sized technology firm with around 500 employees distributed across multiple offices and remote locations. The company emphasizes strong internal communication, culture-building, and professional development.
<p>
Challenge:
As Anycompany grew, internal communications became scattered. The HR team, department heads, and employee resource groups (ERGs) regularly organized various events such as:

Town halls and leadership Q&As

Departmental training sessions

Employee wellness webinars

Hackathons and innovation days

Social gatherings (virtual and physical)

ERG-hosted cultural events

Despite having email and chat tools, employees often missed announcements, forgot to RSVP, or couldnâ€™t keep track of events they were interested in.
<p>

Use Case:

Event Creation: HR and team leads can easily create and schedule events with descriptions, times, locations (virtual or physical), and categories (e.g., Training, Social, Leadership).

Subscriptions: Employees subscribe to topics they care about (e.g., tech talks, wellness, leadership).

Notifications: Users get timely reminders via email, SMS, or in-app alerts when events are published, updated, or about to start.

Engagement Metrics: Admins can view who subscribed, who attended, and get feedback to improve future events.
<p>
Benefits:

Centralized event communication.

Higher participation and engagement.

Personalized notifications instead of spammy email blasts.

Better visibility for event organizers.

<p>
Solution:
Use Amazon Web Services to create a serverless solution to the problem. The user interacts from a web page that allows them to view events, create events and subscribe to the events. The page also shows a dashboard displaying relevant information about the events such as number of notifications delivered, number failed, etc. 
The solution uses AWS Lambda to update a file stored in Amazon S3 that contains a list of events. It also uses another lambda to submit requests to subscribe in SNS. And 
uses an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard to display metrics from the subscription.
